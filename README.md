In order to download and use the code examples provided the Project is accessable on Github. 
Upon start-up, the website will take you to the landing page, from there you can either click the burger icon to log in or log in through the menu option.
The design of this document is different from the original design template that i submitted previously. 
However, some features within this projet dont work as well as they should such as the update and add items sections, 
although i know how to rectify them, i ran out of time and need to submit my project to meet the deadline.


The new features that are added to this are: 
- Logging Page dedicated to either logging in, signing in, or viewing menu
- Log in Avatar that takes user to the logging page from the landing page
- Hovering Cards implemented. JS implemented to ensure that hover feature is included 
- View Hours Section with hours visible. Button is also included to take user home

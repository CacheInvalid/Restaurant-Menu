          <p>
            What is underneath the Chefs hat?&nbsp; A question that many people have asked but none have recieved a proper answer to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back in 1945, &nbsp;a man named Clifford Graves formed a small restaurant in the humble city of Glasgow,&nbsp;
            and wrote the first page of our history.&nbsp;
            From humble beginnings as a small restaurant, &nbsp;we're proud to have become one of the world's leading food service brands with more than 36,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries.

          <h3>Why Dine with Us?</h3>
          <h4> Can you guess whats under the Hat?</h4>
          <p>When we say, “billions served,”&nbsp; we’re not just talking about burgers.&nbsp; We’re talking about serving our communities, customers, crew, farmers, franchisees and suppliers. Because we believe there’s a difference between being in a community and being part of one.</p>
          <p>City lines, county lines, even state lines. These things don’t create communities.&nbsp; People do. We’re consistently inspired by the way people come together in ways big and small to support their communities.&nbsp; But they can’t afford to go it alone – they need support now more than ever.</p>
  
          <p>In response, we would love nothing more than to continue helping our community as best we can.&nbsp; Our delicious burgers and unique vegetarian option has a wide vararity for all! 
            &nbsp; So, why not come by and try and guess whats under the chefs hat.&nbsp; Perhaps you'll find the secret to what makes us the number one restaurant around!</p>

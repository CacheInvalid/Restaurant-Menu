## Frameworks used

## How to run the site
In order to download and use the code examples provided you should clone the repository.Â 
Assumimg you have Git installed on your computer (see https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) open a terminal window in Visual Studio Code ( or use a terminal window provided by your operating system). Type the following command to download the project from a remote server to the folder you are currently in locally
git clone https://github.com/CacheInvalid/Restaurant-Menu.git
Use cd to move to the root directory of the cloned project, npm install to get the node dependancies set up then run the project by typing node index.

Upon start-up, the website will take you to the landing page, from there you can either click the burger icon to log in or log in through the menu option.
The design of this document is different from the original design template that i submitted previously. 
However, some features within this projet dont work as well as they should such as the update and add items sections, 
although i know how to rectify them, i ran out of time and need to submit my project to meet the deadline.

## Additional Information
A test case doc is included in this upload too
A live link to the site: https://cacheinvalid.github.io/Restaurant-Menu/


## Extra Features that have been implemented

- Log in Avatar that takes user to the logging page from the landing page
- Hovering Cards implemented. JS implemented to ensure that hover feature is included 
- View Hours Section with hours visible. Button is also included to take user home


## Justification for any changes from your development plans
My reason for changing the design from its original model was so that it provided a more friendly UI for the user. The design was much more realistic and 
could be implemented compared to previous designs made by myself. The designs on some of the paes may differ from the original doc, 
but they do operate in a similiar manner. This has allowed for an easier access to the database and allowed for a smoother implementation

## UPDATE------>
chef special feature has been implemented
